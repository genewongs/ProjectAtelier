## Instructions for how to deploy the webpage:

Fork this repo into your local machine and do the following.

Create a .env file and copy over the example.env contents
  
Generate your own github api key with these settings:  
- read:org  
- user  
- read:user  
- user:email  
- user:follow  
  
In order to get image upload functionality, please visit https://cloudinary.com/ and create a free account. 
Copy the following into your .env file with these keys. 
  
CLOUD_NAME=  
CLOUD_API_KEY=  
CLOUD_API_SECRET=  
  
Your .env file should end up looking something like this:  
  
PORT="8008"  
APIKEY="GITHUB_API_KEY_HERE"  
  
CLOUD_NAME="CLOUD_NAME_HERE"  
CLOUD_API_KEY="CLOUD_API_KEY_HERE"  
CLOUD_API_SECRET="CLOUD_API_SECRET_HERE"  
  
After finishing your .env file and saving it, you can now run ```npm run build``` to have webpack create the bundle.js that will be served in your server.  
Once that finishes you can run ```npm run start``` which should start up the server.   
  
Navigate in your browser to localhost:(PORT_THAT_YOU_CHOSE_HERE) and you should see the webpage!
